## Entity Listener for Spring Boot

## Todo for application
Need to audit everything we do for the application

Create an auditable (abstract) class this class can be extended to create an
entity listener for any entity. Auditable --> all entities will inherit from this class. so
when every we try to save an entity in the database all of the logic inside of the auditable
will be executed and if we dont have who is updating the data or creating the daa then the execution
will fail. (Ongoing). We can get information from this class but we cant set information from this class. 

```java
    private Long id; //This is going to serve all the subclasses so dont need to define an id from the subclasses.
    private String referenceId =  new AlternativeJdkIdGenerator().generateId().toString(); //Used to identity a specific resource in the database. Anytime we save an entity they get a refID
    private Long createdBy; // WHO CREATED IT.
    private Long updatedBy; //WHO UPDATED IT.
    private LocalDateTime createdAt; //WHO UPDATED IT at what time
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt; //WHO UPDATED IT at what time.
```
This is really all we need for the super class so that all the subclasses can inherit from this 
is also going to be an entity that jpa will manage for us. 

What we have to do now is add the annotation for the required fields.
```java
    @Id
    @SequenceGenerator(name = "primary_key_seq", sequenceName = "primary_key_seq", allocationSize = 1)
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "primary_key_seq")
    @Column(name = "id", updatable = false)
    private Long id; //This is going to serve all the subclasses so don't need to define an id from the subclasses.
    private String referenceId =  new AlternativeJdkIdGenerator().generateId().toString(); //Used to identity a specific resource in the database. Anytime we save an entity they get a refID

    @NotNull
    private Long createdBy; // WHO CREATED IT.
    
    @NotNull
    private Long updatedBy; //WHO UPDATED IT.

    @NotNull
    @Column(name = "created_at", nullable = false, updatable = false)
    @CreatedDate
    private LocalDateTime createdAt; //WHO UPDATED IT at what time

    @Column(name = "updated_at", nullable = false)
    @CreatedDate
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt; //WHO UPDATED IT at what time.
```
**Quotes** 
Explain each annotations and why you need them.

- What we need to do now is implement the logic for prepersit or preupdate do that before we presit 
for any entity we check for all of the field we are setting because we cant save anything in the database 
if we dont have who created it or who updated it or the date they were created or updated.
```java
 @PrePersist
    public void beforePersist() {
        
    }
```
So this method is going to be called before any entity is saved in the database.

The beforePersist() method is used to set the createdAt, createdBy, updatedBy, and updatedAt
fields of an entity before it is persisted. It also checks if a userId is provide
and throws an exception if it is not.

The beforeUpdate() method is used to set the updatedAt and updatedBy fields of an entity before
it is updated. It also checks if a userId is provided and throws an exception if it is not.

So before we save any entity both of the above code is going to run.

The next time I want to work on is the exception handling
```java
public void beforePersist() {
        if (userId == null) { throw new ApiException("Cannot persist entity without user ID in Request  Context for this Thread ");}
```
So we will have to create a new class for exception handling.
```java
public class ApiException extends RuntimeException{
    public ApiException(String message) {super (message); }
    public ApiException() {super ("An error occurred"); }
}
```
The objective of this ApiException class is to provide a custom exception class that can be used to handle exceptions
that occur during the execution of API-related operations in a Java application.
By extending the RuntimeException class, instances of ApiException do not need to be caught or declared explicitly.
This makes it easier to handle API-related exceptions throughout the codebase.
