## Entity Listener for Spring Boot

## Todo for application
Need to audit everything we do for the application

Create an auditable (abstract) class this class can be extended to create an
entity listener for any entity. Auditable --> all entities will inherit from this class. so
when every we try to save an entity in the database all of the logic inside of the auditable
will be executed and if we dont have who is updating the data or creating the daa then the execution
will fail. (Ongoing). We can get information from this class but we cant set information from this class. 

```java
    private Long id; //This is going to serve all the subclasses so dont need to define an id from the subclasses.
    private String referenceId =  new AlternativeJdkIdGenerator().generateId().toString(); //Used to identity a specific resource in the database. Anytime we save an entity they get a refID
    private Long createdBy; // WHO CREATED IT.
    private Long updatedBy; //WHO UPDATED IT.
    private LocalDateTime createdAt; //WHO UPDATED IT at what time
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt; //WHO UPDATED IT at what time.
```
This is really all we need for the super class so that all the subclasses can inherit from this 
is also going to be an entity that jpa will manage for us.
